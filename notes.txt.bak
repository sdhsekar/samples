npm ls --prod --long

	Discovering your dependencies is as easy as running npm ls in your application’s parent folder, which lists the packages you use. You can use the --prod argument to only display production dependencies (which impact your security the most), and add --long to get a short description of each package.
	
	
depcheck 
	Checking for unused dependencies is most easily done using the depcheck tool. depcheck scans your code for requires and import commands, correlate those with the packages installed or mentioned in your package.json, and provide a report. The command can be tweaked in various ways using command flags, making it easy to automate checking for unused dep’s.
	
npm outdated --prod
	You can find out whether or not you’re using the latest version using the npm outdated command. This command also supports the --prod flag to ignore dev dependencies, as well as --json to simplify automation. You can also use Greenkeeper to proactively inform you when you’re not using the latest version.
